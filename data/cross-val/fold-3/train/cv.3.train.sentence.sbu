weathering is the process of breaking down rocks and minerals into smaller pieces...
weathering is the process of breaking down rock.
weathering helps to change the surface of the earth.
as discussed in the previous section, weathering helps to release toxic and potentially toxic elements as well as mineral dusts into surface environments,...
mechanical weathering is the process by which rock is broken into smaller pieces without significant changes in composition.
the process of weathering helps to make soil.
uv radiation is necessary for weathering to occur.
weathering is the process of breaking down solid material such as rock into smaller particles, through agents such as heating, freezing and chemical attack.
deep weathering causes the formation of many secondary and supergene ores  bauxite, iron ores, saprolitic gold, supergene copper, uranium and heavy...
weathering is the process of breaking a large rock into smaller pieces without changing the minerals in the rock.
mechanical weathering is the disintegration of rock into smaller and smaller fragments.
students should have the understanding that evolution is the process by which life progresses from one form into another.
evolution is the process by which we progress until we emerge into the fullness of our destiny as children of god that all god's children will one day reach his...
evolution is the process by which life progresses from one form into another.
the carbon cycle is the process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into the earth and its organisms and then back again.
hibernation occurs when an animal needs to conserve energy to get through the food-scare months of winter.
impaired muscle regeneration in hibernation is caused by inhibition of satellite cell activation and myoblast differentiation.
hibernation is caused by several things.
animals put on fat which is necessary for hibernation.
hibernation is caused by cold, winter conditions.
the purpose of hibernation is to escape the need to burn too much fuel to stay alive during a cold spell when adequate food is not available.
the occurrence of sleep, shallow torpor and hibernation depends on factors such as the environmental temperature, amounts of body fat, extemal.
hibernation is caused by daylight and temperature.
hibernation occurs when the insects are maintained under autumn conditions.
the purpose of hibernation is to conserve energy during a period when sufficient food is scarce.
friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object.
friction is the resistance to motion of one object moving against another.
friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.
the criterion for a chemical change is the production of one or more new substances.
another sign of a chemical change is the release or gain of energy by an object.
an example of a chemical change is the reaction between sodium and water to produce sodium hydroxide and hydrogen.
introduction: chemical change is the process of forming a new substance or substances from...
monitoring ocean chemical change is the promise of mounting chemical sensors on self-reporting ocean floats and gliders.
nitrogen fixation is the process of converting inert atmospheric n2 into biologically usable forms of nitrogen such as ammonium and nitrogen oxides.
biological nitrogen fixation is the process of capturing atmospheric nitrogen by biological processes.
nitrogen fixation is the process of converting atmospheric nitrogen into an inorganic form that plants can use.
nitrogen fixation is the process of reducing atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia, carried out by the enzyme nitrogenase using a source of reductant and energy...
nitrogen fixation is the process of converting unusable nitrogen (atmospheric nitrogen) into usable nitrogen (ammonia).
nitrogen fixation is the process of converting nitrogen gas to a fixed form which is a nitrogenous compound, such as ammonia (nh3) or ammonium (nh4+).
nitrogen fixation is the process by which n2 gas is fixed into a biologically-available form and can be important in.
nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen is taken from its stable gas form (n2) in air and changes into other nitrogen compounds (such as ammonia,...
the purpose of reproduction is to propagate...
reproduction is the process of producing new life.
reproduction is the process of making a new organism, as in parents producing offspring.
reproduction is the process of creating serial homologues of whole animals, and it shouldn't surprise us that the process also occurs on a smaller scale.
reproduction is the process of generating offspring.
reproduction is the process of making offspring.
