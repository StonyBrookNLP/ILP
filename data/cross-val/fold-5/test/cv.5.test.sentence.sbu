hibernation occurs when an animal needs to conserve energy to get through the food-scare months of winter.
impaired muscle regeneration in hibernation is caused by inhibition of satellite cell activation and myoblast differentiation.
hibernation is caused by several things.
animals put on fat which is necessary for hibernation.
hibernation is caused by cold, winter conditions.
the purpose of hibernation is to escape the need to burn too much fuel to stay alive during a cold spell when adequate food is not available.
the occurrence of sleep, shallow torpor and hibernation depends on factors such as the environmental temperature, amounts of body fat, extemal.
hibernation is caused by daylight and temperature.
hibernation occurs when the insects are maintained under autumn conditions.
hibernation occurs when the outside temperature drops usually below 8c and the hedgehog's natural food becomes scarce.
the purpose of hibernation is to conserve energy during a period when sufficient food is scarce.
friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object.
friction is the resistance to motion of one object moving against another.
friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.
the criterion for a chemical change is the production of one or more new substances.
another sign of a chemical change is the release or gain of energy by an object.
evidence of a chemical change is the appearance of floc during the stirring process.
a chemical change is the process of demonstrating a chemical property, such as the burning match in figure 1
